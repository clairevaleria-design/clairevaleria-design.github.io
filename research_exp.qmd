### Research Assistant — Developmental Change and Technology Lab

*University of British Columbia* • 2021–Present

I joined the Developmental Change and Technology Lab in 2021, where my work has focused on understanding how adolescents grow, connect, and make meaning in digital spaces. Much of my research centres on the CyberTeens longitudinal study, where I contribute to both qualitative and quantitative analyses that explore youth smartphone use, social motivations, and developmental patterns over time. I have collaborated on multiple manuscripts, from early conceptual stages through literature reviews, data interpretation, and the journal submission process, and have gained experience navigating the full arc of academic publishing. I also help shape the lab’s knowledge mobilization efforts by managing our social media presence and translating research findings into accessible, public-facing communication.

### Research Assistant — Yatu Lab

*University of British Columbia* • 2024–Present

In the Yatu Lab, I work with Dr. Johanna Sam on projects grounded in Indigenous approaches to resilience, early learning, and youth well-being. My role involves contributing to research design, refining ideas, and supporting manuscript development that centers culturally grounded perspectives on how young people navigate online spaces. Through the lab’s collaborations with the Human Early Learning Partnership (HELP), I help support projects that bridge technology, community knowledge, and holistic development. This work has deepened my commitment to research that is relational, community-engaged, and attentive to cultural context.
