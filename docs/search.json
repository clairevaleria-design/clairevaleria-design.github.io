    "text": "University of British Columbia\n\n\n\n\nI’m a second-year MA student in Human Development, Learning, and Culture at UBC. Before graduate school, I completed my BA in Psychology and Spanish at UBC and spent a year teaching English at a vocational college in Berlin. Watching how often my students turned to their phones sparked my interest in the patterns behind adolescent digital behaviour.\nI now work in the Developmental Change & Technology (DCTech) Lab under Dr. Jennifer Shapka, where I use CyberTeens longitudinal data to study how adolescents’ social goals predict habitual and problematic smartphone use. I’ve been part of the lab since 2021, and my research focuses on how developmental motivations shape digital habits over time.\nOutside of research, I’ve been an artistic swimmer for more than 20 years. The sport continues to shape how I approach my work, discipline, collaboration, precision, and the calm focus that comes from trying to look effortless while upside down underwater.\n\n\n\n\nMaster of Arts, Human Development, Learning & Culture\nUniversity of British Columbia — In progress\nBachelor of Arts, Psychology and Spanish\nUniversity of British Columbia — 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdolescent digital development\n\n\nOnline misinformation\n\n\nProblematic & habitual smartphone use\n\n\nSocial goals and motivation\n\n\nTechnology and well-being\n\n\n\n\n  GitHub \n  LinkedIn \n  Email"

I mentored students during office hours, answered their questions over email, and offered feedback on assignments that aimed to sharpen their thinking rather than simply correct errors. Working alongside Dr. Lillian May, I supported the rhythm of the course: grading, invigilating exams, and building rapport with students who were discovering how psychology lives in the digital world around them. The experience deepened my passion for teaching and reminded me how energizing it is to watch students grow more confident in their ideas.\n\n\n\nEnglish Foreign Language Teaching Assistant\nBerlin, Germany • Sep 2023 – Jun 2024\nMy year in Berlin was a lesson in cultural exchange, curiosity, and humility. As a scholarship recipient through the Pädagogischer Austauschdienst (PAD), I worked closely with students whose backgrounds spanned local neighbourhoods to refugee camps across Europe and the Middle East. I supported teachers with lesson planning and substitution, but the heart of my work happened in conversation, helping students find their voice in English while I learned about their histories, humor, and hopes. I often taught entire lessons on my own, which pushed me to be creative and fully present. That classroom became a place where languages, cultures, and lived experiences converged, and it continues to shape how I approach teaching today."

Much of my research centres on the CyberTeens longitudinal study, where I contribute to both qualitative and quantitative analyses that explore youth smartphone use, social motivations, and developmental patterns over time. I have collaborated on multiple manuscripts, from early conceptual stages through literature reviews, data interpretation, and the journal submission process, and have gained experience navigating the full arc of academic publishing. I also help shape the lab’s knowledge mobilization efforts by managing our social media presence and translating research findings into accessible, public-facing communication. You can learn more about our work on the DCTech Lab website or follow updates on Instagram.\n\n\n\nResearch Assistant — Yatu Lab\nUniversity of British Columbia • 2024–Present\nIn the Yatu Lab, I work with Dr. Johanna Sam on projects grounded in Indigenous approaches to resilience, early learning, and youth well-being. My role involves contributing to research design, refining ideas, and supporting manuscript development that centers culturally grounded perspectives on how young people navigate online spaces. Through the lab’s collaborations with the Human Early Learning Partnership (HELP), I help support projects that bridge technology, community knowledge, and holistic development. This work has deepened my commitment to research that is relational, community-engaged, and attentive to cultural context. You can learn more about our work on the Yatu Lab website."

Before graduate school, I completed my BA in Psychology and Spanish at UBC and spent a year teaching English at a vocational college in Berlin. Watching how often my students turned to their phones sparked my interest in the patterns behind adolescent digital behaviour.\nI now work in the Developmental Change & Technology (DCTech) Lab under Dr. Jennifer Shapka, where I use CyberTeens longitudinal data to study how adolescents’ social goals predict habitual and problematic smartphone use. I’ve been part of the lab since 2021, and my research focuses on how developmental motivations shape digital habits over time.\nOutside of research, I’ve been an artistic swimmer for more than 20 years. The sport continues to shape how I approach my work, discipline, collaboration, precision, and the calm focus that comes from trying to look effortless while upside down underwater.\n\n\n\nEducation\nMaster of Arts, Human Development, Learning & Culture\nUniversity of British Columbia — In progress\nBachelor of Arts, Psychology and Spanish\nUniversity of British Columbia — 2023\n\n\n\nResearch Interests:\n\n\n\n\nAdolescent digital development\n\n\nOnline misinformation\n\n\nProblematic & habitual smartphone use\n\n\nSocial goals and motivation\n\n\nTechnology and well-being\n\n\n\n\n  GitHub \n  LinkedIn \n  Email"
