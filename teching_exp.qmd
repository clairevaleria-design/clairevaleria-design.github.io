### Teaching Assistant — PSYC 325: Socialization, Media, and Its Effects

*University of British Columbia* • Sep 2025 – May 2026

In PSYC 325, I found myself in one of my favourite roles: helping students make sense of how media shapes who we become. I mentored students during office hours, answered their questions over email, and offered feedback on assignments that aimed to sharpen their thinking rather than simply correct errors. Working alongside Dr. Lillian May, I supported the rhythm of the course: grading, invigilating exams, and building rapport with students who were discovering how psychology lives in the digital world around them. The experience deepened my passion for teaching and reminded me how energizing it is to watch students grow more confident in their ideas.

### English Foreign Language Teaching Assistant

*Berlin, Germany* • Sep 2023 – Jun 2024

My year in Berlin was a lesson in cultural exchange, curiosity, and humility. As a scholarship recipient through the Pädagogischer Austauschdienst (PAD), I worked closely with students whose backgrounds spanned local neighbourhoods to refugee camps across Europe and the Middle East. I supported teachers with lesson planning and substitution, but the heart of my work happened in conversation, helping students find their voice in English while I learned about their histories, humor, and hopes. I often taught entire lessons on my own, which pushed me to be creative and fully present. That classroom became a place where languages, cultures, and lived experiences converged, and it continues to shape how I approach teaching today.
